a.	Summary of the project: This section describes the project and its major objectives; 

We worked hard together to finish this project, so we did our best to include all the requirements of this project. Firstly, if you open our website, you will face a login form with the colours blue and purple. In addition, you have to authenticate with a username and password, so you need to entre “user1” as user and “passAdmin01#” as password and press “Log in” in order to go to the questionnaire otherwise it will show an error. In the questionnaire, you have to fill your name and answer all the questions, because if you do not fill all fields, you will see the message “Please Fill All Required Field”. After filling the questionnaire form, you have to press submit in order to see you results. The results will be as pages with your color.
