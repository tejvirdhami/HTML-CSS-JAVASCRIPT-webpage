<h5>At school…<br>
I learn by doing and experiencing, rather than by listening and reading.<br>
I like being physically involved in the learning process and am motivated by my<br>
own natural competitive self and sense of fun.<br>
I am a natural performer.<br>
I like doing tasks that allow me to be independent and free.</h5>
